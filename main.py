TRUE COMBAT
Survive to the end!

RULES
* All players start at a random location on the grid, and have 3 hearts and 0 Action Points.
* Every 24 hours, everyone will receive 1 Action Point (AP).
* At any time you like, you can do one of the four following actions:
    1. Move to an adjacent, unoccupied square (1 AP)
    2. Shoot someone who is within your range (1 AP). Shooting someone removes 1 heart from their health.
    3. Add a heart (3 AP)
    4. Upgrade your range (3 AP)
* At the start of the game, everyone has a range of 2. That is, they can shoot or trade with somehow within 2 squares of them. Upgrading your shooting range increases this by 1 square each time.
* If a player is reduced to 0 hearts, then they are dead. Any action points the dead player had are transferred to the player who killed them. Dead players remain on the board and not removed.
* Players are able to send gifts of hearts or actions points to any player currently within their range.
* Dead players can have a heart sent to them. This will revive that player who will have 1 heart and 0 AP.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
* Dead players form a jury. Each day they vote, and whoever received most votes will be 'haunted', and not revive any AP for that day.
* Once a day, at a random time, a hear will spawn on the field. The first player to move into the square containing the heart will revive an additional heart.
* Action points are secret! Probably a good idea to try and hide how many you have.
* You can't win this game without making some friends and stabbing some backs. Probably.```""")
